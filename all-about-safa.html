        <h1>All About SAFA</h1>
        <h2 style="color: #3dbedb">What is SAFA?</h2>
        <h3 class="no-bold">SAFA is the <b><span style="color: #2B8FF0">Student Association for Filipino Americans</span></b>, based in the
            University of Michigan-Dearborn. It is a student-run organization centered
            around celebrating Filipino culture, improving Filipino lives, and sharing
            that experience with the community.</h3>
        <p style="color: #084477">⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆</p>
        <h2 style="color: #3dbedb">What Activities and Events Does SAFA Hold?</h2>
        <p><b><span style="color: #2B8FF0; text-decoration: underline;">☆ PHILIPPINE CULTURE NIGHT (PCN):</span></b>
            This is SAFA's grand, annual, celebratory event held in March, which features performances, speakers,
            foods, drinks, and many other facets of Filipino culture. Open to the public, PCN is prepared by members of
            SAFA months in advance, with hours of hard work poured into this night of cultural entertainment. Any and
            all proceeds go towards a certain fundraising drive of the organization's choice. We hope
            you're able to join us on stage or in the crowd!</p>
        <p><b><span style="color: #2B8FF0; text-decoration: underline;">☆ SAFAM PROGRAM:</span></b> Based on a house system, 
            SAFA members are placed into one of three SAFAMs (Hadiys, Pss!eidon, Zeusmaryosep) after taking a fun personality quiz.
            SAFAMs go against one another in friendly competitions throughout the year, which can include anything from Filipino
            cooking contests, to seeing which SAFAM can donate the most clothes in a clothing drive. Members can also earn points
            for their SAFAM by getting involved in SAFA events, such as GBMs, Philippine Culture Night, or even fun out-of-town trips.
            Whichever SAFAM obtains the most points by the end of the year wins a cash prize. May the SAFAM win!</p>
        <p><b><span style="color: #2B8FF0; text-decoration: underline;">☆ AKA (ATE-KUYA-ADING) PROGRAM:</span></b>
            In conjunction with SAFAMs, the AKA Program acts as a mentorship system where each SAFA member is paired with 
            an Ate (older sister in Tagalog), Kuya (older brother in Tagalog), and Ading (younger sibling in Tagalog) within
            their SAFAM. This program is designed with the goal of forming a cohesive community by 
            establishing smaller groups that an individual member can focus on and connect with.</p>
        <p><b><span style="color: #2B8FF0; text-decoration: underline;">☆ TRADITIONAL AND MODERN DANCES:</span></b>
            SAFA members have the opportunity to learn both traditional and modern dances, which includes tinikling, tiklos, and
            choreographies to current Asian-American music. No prior dance experiencces is required! These dances are also often
            performed at SAFA's Philippine Culture Night, or other cultural events.</p>
        <p><b><span style="color: #2B8FF0; text-decoration: underline;">☆ VOLUNTEER EVENTS:</span></b> SAFA is involved in
            community work around the Metro Detroit area and abroad in the Philippines. Some examples include organizing
            clothing drives and communal gardening with HUDA Urban Garden.
        <p><b><span style="color: #2B8FF0; text-decoration: underline;">☆ GENERAL BODY MEETINGS:</span></b> Every few weeks,
            general body meetings are held as an opportunity for SAFA members to come together, get updated about news regarding
            the organization, and bond through discussions, games, food, and joke langs. In addition, SAFA loves to also eat out
            informally after meetings, in various places within Dearborn's delicious food scene.</p>
        <p><b><span style="color: #2B8FF0; text-decoration: underline;">☆ STUDY SESSIONS:</span></b> SAFA members often get
            together in various places around the University of Michigan-Dearborn campus to hang out and study together before and
            after classes. These allow for SAFA members to bond while also focusing on their academics.</p>
